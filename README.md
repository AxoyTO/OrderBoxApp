#### Description: 
OrderBoxApp is a user-friendly web application designed to simplify the process of ordering meals and drinks from a menu. Developed as a final project for CS50, the application is built using Python Flask, ensuring a seamless and responsive experience for its users.

The core functionality of OrderBoxApp revolves around a well-organized database consisting of four primary tables: Orders, Cart, User, and Menu. These tables work in tandem to provide a streamlined ordering process for users.

To begin, users can create an account or log in using their existing credentials. The User table securely stores user information, allowing for personalized experiences and order history.

Once logged in, users are presented with a visually appealing menu showcasing a wide array of meals and drinks. Each item is accompanied by a description, price, and an enticing image to help users make informed choices. The Menu table acts as a comprehensive repository, ensuring that the menu remains up-to-date and accurate.

OrderBoxApp allows users to add their desired items to their virtual shopping cart. The Cart table serves as a temporary storage space for selected items, enabling users to review and modify their selections before finalizing their order. This feature ensures flexibility and ease of use during the decision-making process.

Once users have confirmed their order, OrderBoxApp seamlessly moves the selected items from the cart to the Orders table. This table stores all relevant details related to each completed order, including the user's information, the items ordered, and the total cost. This information is essential for both users and administrators, as it allows for efficient order tracking and management.

Overall, OrderBoxApp provides a convenient and efficient solution for ordering meals and drinks. Whether it's a quick lunch break or a weekend treat, users can rely on the application's intuitive interface, extensive menu options, and robust database infrastructure. Developed with Python Flask, the application delivers a reliable and responsive experience, ensuring customer satisfaction and promoting hassle-free food ordering.
